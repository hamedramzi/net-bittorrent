=head1 NAME

Net::BitTorrent peer ID Specification

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This document describes and provides examples of the peer ID format
used by the current release of the Net::BitTorrent module.

=head1 FORMAT

This non-standard format was developed to be URL-safe, unique to the
implementation, and "human parsable."

There are three distinct sections to the peer IDs generated. Example
peer ID:

 NB004S-rogzGB1v--SVN

Where C<NB004S> is the header, C<-rogzGB1v> is the mid-section, and
C<--SVN> is the signature.

=head2 Header

Two uppercase characters ('C<NB>') followed by three digits
representing the SVN revision number with leading zeros, a single
character potentially indicating stability and how the release was
obtained, and a single hyphen (C<->).

If the client is a CPAN build, the sixth byte is the capital letter
'C<C>'.  If the client is running a version checked out from public
SVN (considered unstable), the sixth byte is the capital letter 'S'.
Any other characters in the sixth byte are unsupported and may
indicate a bad client.

=head2 Mid-section

Following that are eight random characters in the following range:

 ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789-._~

That is, all uppercase and lowercase letters, decimal digits, as well
as the hyphen, period, underscore, and tilde (66 total).  These are
all characters allowed in a URL without encoded (referred to as
"Unreserved Characters in [rfc://3986]) to reduce weight on the
tracker during announce.  On a popular tracker, every bit (and byte)
helps.

This section is inspired by the pseudo-base64 set used by SHADOW's
BitTornado client.

=head2 Signature

The final five characters may be random or static and should not be
used in identifying the version of the client software.  Some early
versions even have my name in this spot.  .:shrugs:.

=head1 CPAN VERSION NUMBERS

Stable CPAN releases will have the sixth byte set to 'C<C>'.

Unstable (referred to as DEVELOPER releases on PAUSE) releases on
CPAN will have this bit set as if the user checked the source out
from SVN, that is, the sixth byte will be 'C<S>'.  These will be
released on CPAN with version numbers matching C<m[\d\.\d+_\d]>.

See the PAUSE FAQ section entitled "Developer Releases"
([L<http://www.cpan.org/modules/04pause.html>])

Version numbers will be some value less than zero with the revision
number in the three significant decimal places. For more, see the
L</EXAMPLES> section.

=head1 EXAMPLES

=over

=item C<NB393C-04.9EraQ--SVN>

This would be the stable CPAN release C<v0.393>.  The C<--SVN>
signature should be ignored.

=item C<NB003X-9E-ayR6b-BTE<lt>3>

Improper peer ID; the sixth bit is neither 'C' nor 'S'. Possibly
fake.

=item C<NB065S--09Egae69sy8W>

Completely legal peer ID generated by SVN/Dev r65.

=head1 FUTURE IDEAS

Eventually, I would like to make a v1.0 release of Net::BitTorrent on
CPAN.  The information in this document and the means of generating
the module's version number will need to reflect that.  These changes
will not affect peer ID parsing though.
