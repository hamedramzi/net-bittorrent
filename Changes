  - Callback system is complete.
    + N::B::S::Tracker was the holdup...

 Issues resolved:
  - None

 Internal changes:
  - None

 Notes:
  - Upgrade is not required in general but recommended for heavy callback users.

Version 0.020 | 2008-05-22 19:09:05 -0400 (Thu, 22 May 2008)

 API changes:
  - Experimental N::B::use_unicode() has been removed as wide char filenames
      are now handled transparently on Win32.
  - New accessor: N::B::Session::name() - see N::B::Session docs
  - New methods for alternative event processing:
    + N::B::process_connections() - implement your own select() statement
    + N::B::process_timers() - easily keep internal timers up to date
  - Experimental kbps_up and kbps_down methods and N::B::new() parameters have
      been renamed properly: kBps_up, kBps_down.  Bits.  Bytes.  It happens.

 Issues resolved:
  - #1: Line 231 Piece.pm - Check existence of $self->session->files->[$f]->size
    + New .torrent metadata integrity checks during add_session() and piece
        read/write.
    + Log warning and undef returned when N::B::add_session() is handed a
        .torrent that does not contain files. (eh, it's a start)

 Internal changes:
  - Plenty of layout and ideology changes.  None of which immediately affect
      usability or behavior.
  - Extended charset filenames are now handled properly on Win32.
    + Depends on properly encoded utf8 metadata (and the J-Pop fans rejoice)
  - (The piece containing) Outgoing blocks are verified for integrity before
      being sent to remote peers.  Just in case.

 Notes:
  - Upgrade is recommended in general.
  - Upgrade is strongly recommended for Win32 systems.
  - New sample code: scripts/web-gui.pl
    + ÂµTorrent WebUI-like demo of alternative event processing.
  - To keep N::B from growing too messy and to make co-development attractive,
      I'm imposing some coding standards, defining what should be internal,
      and deciding how N::B should behave.  Between that and the nice weather,
      the addition of new features (DHT, UDP trackers, etc.) will be pushed
      back a bit.  The next few releases will probably be bugfix, API, and
      base protocol-behavioral changes.
  - Documentation rework in progress.
  - What's the cutoff for apologizing for things you said in high school?

Version 0.018 | 2008-04-24 21:14:52 -0400 (Thu, 24 Apr 2008)

 API changes:
  - Old style set_callback_* syntax is depreciated.
  - New methods: kbps_up, kbps_down
  - New optional parameters for N::B::new(): kbps_up, kbps_down

 Internal changes:
  - Fixed crash bug in N::B::S::Peer during endgame

 Notes:
  - Upgrade is strongly recommended.
  - New feature: Transfer limits to control how much bandwidth N::B is
      allowed to use.
  - No longer causes taint warnings.
  - perl 5.8.1 required.  This is based solely on available CPAN
      Reporter PASS/FAIL tests and may not be a true representative
      value.

Version 0.015 | 2008-04-11 20:00:26 -0400 (Fri, 11 Apr 2008)

 Notes:
  - Dup of 0.013 to fix bad M::B dist.  Something fishy going on with
    the gzip'd file.  Some systems (like PAUSE) properly extract
    directories and some (like the cpan shell) extract it all into the
    base directory causing build failures.

Version 0.013 | 2008-04-11 13:30:36 -0400 (Fri, 11 Apr 2008)

 API changes:
  - log callbacks now include a message level.  See
     N::B::Util/"LOG LEVELS".
  - removed peer_outgoing_packet callback in favor of more specific,
     per-packet-type callbacks.

 Internal changes:
  - Fixed a bug causing files to be re-opened every time they are read.
  - Tons of N::B::S::Peer refactoring.  (and much more to do)
  - Early Fast Peers and Ext. Protocol testing. (disabled by default)

 Notes:
  - Upgrade is recommended.
  - This is a documentation update.  100% coverage.
