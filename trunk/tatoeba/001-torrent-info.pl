=head1 NAME

/tatoeba/001-torrent-info.pl - Use Net::BitTorrent to gather information

=head1 Description

This is a demonstration of how standalone C<Net::BitTorrent::Torrent>
objects can be created and used to gather information from a .torrent
file.

=head1 Synopsis

 001-torrent-info.pl

=head1 Lowdown

=over

=item Line 6

Returns a new C<Net::BitTorrent::Torrent> object.  Created this way,
(without a 'C<Client>' parameter) the new object is not loaded into a
parent C<Net::BitTorrent> client.

You may use any of the arguments listed in
L<Net::BitTorrent::Torrent|Net::BitTorrent::Torrent/"new ( { [ARGS] } )">'s
constructor.  If there's a problem loading the .torrent, an error will
(probably) be C<Carp>ed by C<Net::BitTorrent::Torrent>.

=item Line 8

Calls the debugging method
L<as_string|Net::BitTorrent::Torrent/"as_string ( [ VERBOSE ] )"> just
to give you a rundown of what can be parsed from the file.

=item Line 9

Prints a dump of the .torrent file's
L<metadata|Net::BitTorrent::Torrent/"raw_data ( [ RAW ] )">.

=item Line 10

Prints a list of the .torrent's
L<files|Net::BitTorrent::Torrent/"files ( )">.  This line also uses the
L<path|Net::BitTorrent::Torrent::File/"path ( )"> method from
L<Net::BitTorrent::Torrent::File|Net::BitTorrent::Torrent::File>.
