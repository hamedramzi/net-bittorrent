= Peer ID Specification =

This section describes and provides examples of the Peer ID format used by this release of the `Net::BitTorrent` module.

== Overview ==

This non-standard format was developed to be URL-safe, unique to the implementation, and "human parsable."

There are two distinct sections to the Peer IDs generated: the header which may be used to identify the software and its version, and the signature which is... well, it's junk. Consider this example:

{{{
 NB004S-rogzGB1v--SVN
}}}

Here, {{{NB004S}}} is the header and {{{-rogzGB1v--SVN}}} is the trailing signature.

=== Header ===

The header consists of two uppercase characters ('{{{NB}}}') followed by three digits (with leading zeros) representing the SVN revision, and a single character used to (potentially) indicate stability.

If the client is a stable build, the sixth character is the capital letter '{{{C}}}' (as these are usually obtained from CPAN). If the client is a version checked out from SVN, the sixth character is the capital letter '{{{S}}}'. Any other characters in the sixth byte are unsupported and may indicate a bad client.

=== Signature ===

The remainder of the Peer ID is a hyphen followed by 13 random characters in the following range:

{{{
 ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789-._~
}}}

That is, all uppercase and lowercase letters, decimal digits, as well as the hyphen, period, underscore, and tilde (66 total). These are all characters allowed in a URL without being encoded (referred to as "Unreserved Characters" in rfc://3986) to reduce weight on the tracker during announce.

== Version Numbers and Stability ==

Version numbers will be some value less than one ({{{1}}}) with the revision number in the three significant decimal places.

Stable revisions will have the sixth char set to '{{{S}}}' (capital letter 's'). The most recent of these stable builds will be found on CPAN.

Unstable revisions will have the sixth char set to '{{{U}}}' (capital letter 'u'). These will most likely be SVN checkouts and temporary uploads to CPAN where the package's filename matches {{{m[\d\.\d+_\d]}}}. See the PAUSE FAQ section entitled "Developer Releases" (http://www.cpan.org/modules/04pause.html).

== Examples ==

{{{NB393S-04.9EraQ--SVN}}}
This would be the stable CPAN release {{{v0.393}}}/SVN r393. The {{{--SVN}}} signature does not imply an unstable build.

{{{NB003X-9E-ayR6-I<3BT}}}
Improper Peer ID; the sixth char is neither '{{{S}}}' nor '{{{U}}}'.

{{{NB065C--09Egae69sy8W}}}
Completely legal Peer ID generated by unstable SVN/Dev r65.
