=head1 NAME

Net::BitTorrent::Notes - Annotated Guide to the Ins and Outs of Net::BitTorrent

=head1 Description

L<Net::BitTorrent|Net::BitTorrent> is a mess.

But it doesn't have to be!  This document is a first draft attempt at
defining a roadmap for future C<Net::BitTorrent> development and a
behavioral reference for third-party client developers.  There are bits in
here that may be of some use to regular users too.

Note: C<Net::BitTorrent::Notes> and the ideas behind it are a work in
progress.

=head1 Installation

This distribution uses C<Module::Build> for installation, so use the
following procedure:

  perl Build.PL
  ./Build
  ./Build test
  ./Build install

If you would like to contribute automated test reports (and I hope
you do), first install C<CPAN::Reporter> from the CPAN shell and then
install C<Net::BitTorrent>:

 $ cpan
 cpan> install CPAN::Reporter
 cpan> reload cpan
 cpan> o conf init test_report
   [...follow the CPAN::Reporter setup prompts...]
 cpan> o conf commit
 cpan> install Net::BitTorrent

For more on becoming a CPAN tester and why this is useful, please see
the L<CPAN::Reporter|CPAN::Reporter/"DESCRIPTION"> documentation,
L<http://cpantesters.perl.org/>, and the CPAN Testers Wiki
(L<http://cpantest.grango.org/>)

=head2 Prerequisites

C<Net::BitTorrent> requires L<version|version> and
L<Digest::SHA|Digest::SHA>.  On Win32, we require
L<Win32API::File|Win32API::File> and L<Encode|Encode> when handling
.torrents holding files with extended charset filenames.*  As of perl
5.10, all of these modules are are CORE; they come bundled with the
distribution.

I have listed these modules as prerequisites in Build.PL so, unless you
answer 'no' when prompted, the CPAN shell should automagically install
them for you.

* We also use the internal C<utf8()> functions which didn't appear until
perl 5.8.1.  See L<Portability Hacks|/"Portability Hacks">.

=head1 How Do I...

Parts that aren't handled internally are described here with sample code
to get you started.  In the future, this will probably be in a separate
pod.

=head2 Pause and Resume a .torrent Session

[TODO]

=head2 Stop and Resume a .torrent Session

[TODO]

=head2 Quick Resume a .torrent Session Between Client Sessions

Early versions of N::B had resume built in but it was removed for various
reasons.  Adding this yourself is trivial, fortunately.  For each
torrent, store the bitfield, nodes (compact list of peers), piece
priorities, and the modified times for each file just to be safe.  Oh,
and a list of the current 'working' pieces and their progress.  Saving
the DHT ID and routing table would be a good idea too.  Add to that some
sort of verification scheme to be sure you're loading information that
hasn't been tampered with or corrupted.  Then, when you load the torrent,
reload the torrent with your stored data.

=head2 Piece Selection

To have any symbolance of basic functionality, a BitTorrent client must
have a good piece selection strategy.  The 'strict priority' based
algorhythm used by L<Net::BitTorrent|Net::BitTorrent> seems to strike a
balance between efficiency and speed while keeping the pipes full of
incoming data.  Here's the pseudocode:

=over 4

=item *

Count the number of unrequested C<$free_blocks> in all working pieces.

=item *

Count how many C<$free_slots> we have open to us.  To calculate this, we
iterate through all peers who aren't choking us adding the difference
between the total number of outgoing requests and the peer-defined
maximum or our own internal 'safe' max of 20.

=item *

C<$max_working> is set to the current number of working pieces plus the
bool value of C<$free_blocks E<lt> $free_slots>.

=item *

Calculating the priority C<@weights> relys on [TODO]

=begin :reference

 (scalar(grep { $_->working } @{$pieces{$self}})
                     < $max_working    # TODO: Make this ratio variable
                )
                ? (grep {
                               not $_->check
                           and $_->priority
                           and vec($peer->bitfield, $_->index, 1)
                           and ($_->working
                                ? (scalar grep { scalar $_->peers == 0 }
                                   values %{$_->blocks})
                                : 1
                           )
                       } @{$pieces{$self}}
                    )
                : (grep {
                       $_->working    # and $pieces{$self}->[$_->index]
                           and (scalar grep { scalar $_->peers == 0 }
                                values %{$_->blocks})
                       } @{$pieces{$self}}
                )

=end :reference

If C<@weights> is empty, we return without making a new request.

=item *

Take the sum of all the relative (priority) weights and call it C<$total>

=item *

Take a random number between 0 and 1, and multiply it by C<$total>. Call
the new number C<$rand_val>

=item *

While C<$rand_val> is positive, iterate through each element of
C<@weights> and do the following:

=over 4

=item *

Subtract the (priority) weight of the element from C<$rand_val> and
increment a temporary index C<$i>

=item *

If C<$rand_val> went negative or we run out of values for C<@weights>, we
exit the loop.

=back

=item *

If C<$weights[$i]> is defined, we set the working value to true and
request a free L<block|Net::BitTorrent::Session::Piece::Block>.  Blocks
are requested in order from the beginning of the piece to the end.
Finally, we re-request any rejected or canceled blocks.

=item *

...otherwise, we return an undefined value.

=back

The language used in this section probably only makes sense to me and
will require a rewrite.  For the actual code, see
C<Net::BitTorrent::Session::_pick_piece()>.

=head2 Portability Hacks

Net::BitTorrent aims to be portable between the big three OS When
possible, this should be achieved without a glut of code using easily
obtained third-party modules.  Core modules are considered first
followed by well tested CPAN modules.  Modules that prevent broad use
(ie. fails to install on a majority of systems) will not be considered.

There will be times, though, that C<$^O>-based clutter is needed.  Here
is a list of both stable and experimental workarounds by OS:

=head2 Bug Reporting

Right now, the best way to contribute would be through bug reports and
patch submissions.

Before creating a new report through C<Net::BitTorrent>'s
L<Issue Tracker|/"Issue Tracker">, please review the following list:

=over 2

=item *

Make sure you are using the most recent release of C<Net::BitTorrent>.
This may mean checking out the latest svn commit.  All patches should be
made against the most recent revision and well tested.  For a list of svn
clients, some of which make patch creation a little easier, see
L<http://subversion.tigris.org/links.html#clients>.

=item *

Make sure the bug is reproducible.

=item *

Please write in clear English.

=item *

Include as much detail as possible when describing the bug.  Provide
"baby steps" to describe exactly how to replicate the bug.  Sample code
is welcome.  Net::BitTorrent's issue tracker also allows attachments so,
if relevant, also include the .torrent file regardless of its content.

=item *

Search the list of open and resolved issues to make sure the flaw hasn't
already been reported.  If it has, you can star the issue to stay up to
date.  You'll know what I mean by 'star' it when you get there...  I can
see how many people have stars on a particular issue and popular bugs get
priority.

=item *

Issues are open to the public, so don't include passwords or other
confidential information.  Beyond that, you can never provide too much
information in a bug report.

=item *

One bug is one bug report.  Please do not include multiple, separate
issues in one report unless they are explicitly related to each other.

=item *

If the bug is related to one .torrent in particular, please attach it to
your report.

=item *

It never hurts to do a little homework.  If you run into a problem, find
the place that's causing trouble and manage to fix it, please attach a
patch (diff against the latest svn revision) or at least a very good
description (with code) of what you did.

=item *

Star the issue so you can stay up to date with my progress.

=item *

Look over your report before submission to be sure you've included as
much detail as possible.  Seriously.  Get up, have a drink of water, come
back, read over it again to make sure you've included everything you
intended, and then submit.

=back

=head2 Co-Development and Patch Submission

C<Net::BitTorrent> is too large for just one person to hack on.  If
you're Perl proficient and would like to help, you can start by fixing
problems reported in the L<Issue Tracker|/"Issue Tracker"> and bugs you
find on your own.  When I decide to start looking for permanant co-devs,
you'll already have your foot in the door.

Please submit patches for review by attaching it through the
C<Net::BitTorrent> L<Issue Tracker|/"Issue Tracker">.  If it's a patch to
fix an existing Issue, use that thread.  Otherwise, create a new Issue.
Minor patches get your name in the changelog.  Major (security,
especially) patches get your name in the
L<Acknowledgments|Net::BitTorrent/Acknowledgments> section.  Oooo.
Ahhh.
